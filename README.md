# Local Photo Search Demo

## What is this app?
This app allows users to import photos that then get classified locally, on the users device. Those classifications are then used to enable searching through your photos, all without having to go to the cloud.

## Key Technical Features
- All AI is local, running on the GPU or the NPU (although GPU by default at the moment) using WebNN
